1. Fork this repository. Don't clone it! ([How to fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo))
2. Add some styles! Make this thing... less ugly.
3. Use JavaScript to generate all of the data in `product.js` to render out HTML for showing the product.html page.
4. Raise a pull request to my repository, not yours. ([How to make a pull request to a forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork))
